# Binomial heap implementation with applications:-
### APS_project
This Repository contains the various cpp files:

1. binomialheap.cpp is the file containing code for binomial heap implementation.
2. avltree.cpp is the file containing code for AVL tree implementation.
3. rbtree.cpp is the file containing code for RB tree implementation.

# Implementation of application of binomial heap i.e Prims using binomial heap:-

4. primbinomial.cpp is the program for Prims algorithm implementation using binomial heap.
5. primPriorityQueue.cpp is the standard Prims algorithm implemented using priority queue.

Other files like:=  <br>
a) randomdata.txt for random input.(containing 2000000 numbers) <br>
b) sortednumbers.txt for ascending sorted input.(containing 2000000 numbers)  <br>
c) reversesorted.txt for descending sorted input.(containing 2000000 numbers)  <br>
These are testcase files to give inputs to insert, search and delete in Binomial heap, AVL and RB tree.  <br>

--> graph1.txt....graph4.txt are sample test cases for primbinomial.cpp to check MST.  <br>

i) The folder Number generator files contains the programs to generate random, sorted ascending and sorted descending numbers for inputs to Binomial heap, AVL and RB tree.  <br>
ii) The folder Graph plot files contains the python programs to plot various graphs used for time comparison between three data structures.  <br>
iii) The folder Graph contains the images of various graphs used in report file.  <br>

--> APS_Project_report.tex and <b> APS_Project_report.pdf </b> are the report files which contains the detailed description of the project and our observations along with the details of how to run the program files.
